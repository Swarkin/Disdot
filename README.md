## What?

A Discord bot framework made in Godot Engine. (This certainly is more of an _experiment_ than an actual addon as of now.)  
Currently, a bunch of Discord's data types are implemented, as well as some API endpoints.

There's also a WIP attempt of making an UI for the Bot, but that is nowhere near usable yet.  

## Why?

After the random thought of _"lol what if i make discord in godot"_, I came across the idea of actually making a Discord bot "framework" inside of Godot to try and see what'll happen.  
And right now, you're seeing the Github page of this experiment.
